  <blockquote>Much of [...] venturesome botanizing in India has run aground in more recent times in institutions like the Botanical Survey of India. And the Forest Research Institute. That’s why it’s such good news that young people like Ashwini Bhatia are exploring and writing and infecting people with their enthusiasm.<br>

  I am so delighted with Ashwini Bhatia’s beautiful and inspirational book on the orchids of the Dharamshala area. I don’t know if Ashwini realizes that he stands in a long line of plantspeople who have contributed so much to what we know about plants and their habitats.</blockquote>
